    <b>Contrary </b>to popular belief, <em>Lorem Ipsum </em>emis not simply random text. It has <sub>roots in a
    piece</sub> of<br>
    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <b><em>Richard McClintock</em></b>, a<br>
    Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin<br>
    words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
    <mark>passage</mark>
    , and going through the cites of the word in<br>
    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32<br>
    and 1.10.33<sup>[1]</sup> of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written <br>
    in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br>
    The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br>
